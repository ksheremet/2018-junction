# FunCon - Junction 2018

You participate in conversations every day, but when was the last time someone gave you meaningful feedback? ↔️ How confident is the language that you are using? 🗣️ Or are you using a lot of swear words? 💩Do you listen to other people' opinions? 👂Do  you take equal part in conversations? 🔇

Improve your conversation skills with this fun app, where you get a rating of the conversations that you had 💯. And have a lot of fun doing it! 🎉

We used React and TypeScript, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the voice recognition, we use the web speech API. The charts are designed with charts.js and for the emojis, we use node emoji.
